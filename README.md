## Description
I created a coding quiz where you can test your knowledge on coding. You have 30 seconds to answer 3 questions if you answer correctly you get 1 point and if you get a question wrong you lose 5 seconds on your time. At the end of the quiz the code should tell you how many questions you got correct and give you a prompt to store your initials.
